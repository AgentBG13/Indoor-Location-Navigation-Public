# DISCLAIMER: this code is still work in progress and is expected to be finalized around May 26, 2021.  

## Steps to obtain the approximate winning submission
1. Clone the repository, it doesn't matter where you clone it to since the source code and data are disentangled.
1. Create a project folder on a disk with at least 150GB of free space. Create a "Data" subfolder in your project folder. This will be referred to as "your data folder" in what follows.
1. Download the raw text data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/indoor-location-navigation/data) and extract it into your data folder.
1. Download the cleaned raw data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tomokikmogura/indoor-location-navigation-path-files?select=train) and extract it into the "reference_preprocessed" subfolder of your data folder.
1. Add your data folder to line 19 in src/utils.py
1. Run main.py
  
If all goes well, the pipeline should create a "final_submissions" subfolder in your data folder with two final submissions. Note that these are likely slightly different from our actual submissions due to inherent training stochasticity.

## Hardware requirements
Due to the size of the data set, you need at least 32 GB RAM to be able to run the pipeline successfully.

## Known issues
- If you run out of memory, try running the pipeline again. It should continue where it left it in the previous run.
